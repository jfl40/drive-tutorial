## Next Steps

### Folder deletions

Make sure to fetch all of the folders that have it as a parent and their children too. Recursively find all of them and collect them all to then delete

### Folder creations

Make server action that takes a name and parentId and creates a folder with that name and parentId, and creates a folder with that name and parentId (set ownerId as well to assign the folder to the user)

### Access control

3:24:44
Check if user is the owner of the folderId before allowing the user to access folder

### Make a "file view" page

Check his last video tutorial for inline image examples

### Toasts

### Gray out a row while being deleted

### Correctly dislay file type and store in db

Done
